🐍 Revised README.md Structure: Focusing on Back-End🌟 Project: Shadow Be Fearless - Security & Geo-Spatial Threat Monitoring Platform💡 Overview & Problem SolvedShadow Be Fearless is a security application designed to enhance women's safety during travel by providing features for real-time monitoring, reporting, and emergency response.The core technical challenge was developing a robust, multi-user Flask-based RESTful API capable of handling simultaneous, real-time requests from a mobile user base (emergency shake service, location viewing) and disparate web clients (Admin, Police, Subadmin).🛠️ Technical Stack & ArchitectureComponentTechnologyRole in the ProjectBack-EndFlask (Python)Core logic, routing, and processing of all web and mobile requests.DatabaseSQLlog (SQLite)Data persistence for user accounts, location data, complaints, and vehicle/admin management.APIRESTful ServicesBuilt endpoints for data exchange between the Flask server, the Java mobile application, and web clients.Front-EndHTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JSPresentation layer for Admin, Subadmin, and Police web portals.MobileJava (Android) & VolleyClient-side application for real-time user interaction and emergency services.DevelopmentPyCharm, WAMPDevelopment environment and local server setup.🧠 Back-End Focus & ContributionsThis section is where you highlight your Python Back-End skills.API Design & Implementation: Developed and documented [X] RESTful endpoints using Flask, covering key functionalities like user authentication, complaint submission, and real-time location updates.Data Modeling & ORM: Designed the [Y] primary database models (e.g., User, Complaint, Location) and managed data integrity using Flask's ORM layer for SQLlog/SQLite.Geo-Spatial Logic: Implemented back-end logic for processing "Managing Safe and Dangerous Locations" data, including photo analysis and verification workflows used by the Subadmin role.Asynchronous Tasks (Implied): Handled the immediate, high-priority nature of the "Shake Service" emergency feature, ensuring the server could rapidly receive and notify police/admin users.Multi-Role Authorization: Implemented role-based access control (Admin, Subadmin, Police) to restrict API access and features based on the logged-in user's credentials.✨ Key Features ImplementedAdmin Platform: Vehicle/Notification/Role Management, Feedback Review.Subadmin Platform: Safe/Dangerous Location Management & Verification Workflow.Police Platform: Real-Time Emergency Request Viewing and Dangerous Spot Vetting.Mobile User Features: Add Complaint, View Locations, Shake Service for Immediate Emergency Response, User Chat.🏃 How to Run the Project LocallyClone the Repository:Bashgit clone [Your GitHub URL Here]
